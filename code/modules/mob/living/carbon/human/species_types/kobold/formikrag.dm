	Hobknoblits are a twisted bastardization of the common Knoblit through the evil manipulation \
	of the Faerie Devil, Hertannea. Her tampering was intended to create a legion of monsters to \
	serve Her bidding in Palasi Necra. Though no matter how hard She toiled, She could never mold \
	them to suit Her needs. Hobknoblits are a somewhat recent creation, being dark-scaled, more \
	rancid and quick-witted Knoblits with a set of wings gifted by Her touch. Assumedly, Hertannea \
	uses the Hobknoblits as Her eyes and ears beyond Palasi Necra, but many believe She simply wanted \
	them to go away and made them our problems instead. Unlike normal Knoblits, Hobknoblits are seen \
	as daemonic imps in nature, and are often killed whenever they are seen by civilized folk.<br> \
